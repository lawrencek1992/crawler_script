Crawler Coding Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to implement a console application that displays the most common words used in a portion of a webpage.
Requirements
The code should be written in C#, Python, or Java.
The code should return the most common words used and the number of times they are used. The following should be configurable:
The number of words to return (default: 10)
Words to exclude from the search
Your code (only the source code, no binaries) should be returned as a zip posted within the contractor hub tool along with your resume. The code should build into an executable console application.

Only words from the section “history” should be accounted for.
